# Machine-Learning-for-Trading

### Implemented the following projects:

Conducted stock market portfolio analysis using Pandas (see /mc1_p1/)

Optimized a portfolio to optimally allocate funds to each stock to optimize itâ€™s performance (see /mc1_p2/)

Created a market simulator that accepts trading orders and keeps track of a portfolio's value over time and then assesses the performance of that portfolio.  (see /mc2_p1/)

Developed trading strategies using Technical Analysis, and then tested them using my market simulator. (see /mc2_p2/)

Implement and evaluated a KNN learner, Linear Regression learner and a Bootstrap Aggregating learner. (see /mc3_p1/)

Transformed my regression learner into a stock trading strategy (see /mc3_p2/)

Implemented and assessed Q-Learning to solve a navigation problem (see /mc3_p3/)
