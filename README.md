# Machine-Learning-for-Trading

### Implemented the following projects in Python:

Conducted stock market portfolio analysis using Pandas (see MC1-Project-1)

Optimized a portfolio to optimally allocate funds to each stock to optimize its performance (see MC1-Project-2)

Created a market simulator that accepts trading orders and keeps track of a portfolio's value over time and then assesses the performance of that portfolio  (see MC2-Project-1)

Developed trading strategies using Technical Analysis, and then tested them using my market simulator (see MC2-Project-2)

Built a Stock Market Simulator and Predictor using Python and Pandas and used it to optimize a portfolio

Implement and evaluated a KNN learner, Linear Regression learner, and a Bootstrap Aggregating learner (see MC3-Project-1)

Transformed my regression learner into a stock trading strategy (see MC3-Project-2)

Implemented and assessed Q-Learning to solve a navigation problem (see MC3-Project-3)

Projects are written in Python 2.7
